# Quick start

## Setup Talkbot on your discord

Getting Talkbot working is a fairly straight forward process:

1. Add Talkbot to your server here: [https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client\_id=428866923267358721&scope=bot&permissions=0](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=428866923267358721&scope=bot&permissions=0)
2. Type !follow to get it to join your voice channel
3. Type 'hello world' to hear it speak.
