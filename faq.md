## Why do you use Futurama quotes for Github commit messages?

We had a pretty patchy commit message system, so rather than try and actually write what we've changed, we just standardised on a simple, automated approach to commit messages that is consistent.

It doesn't serve any real purpose other than removing the cognitive overhead of trying to figure out what we changed.

If I ever need to know where that bug fix is it's in the "[Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg!](https://github.com/nullabork/talkbot/commit/f6cc5f89231b74373113e22db2ae0da28eb7eddd)" commit.

## Can I setup bot on my own linux server?

Yes! The code is freely available on our [github site here](https://github.com/nullabork/talkbot). Note this is an advanced topic that will require you to understand how to perform linux system administration.
