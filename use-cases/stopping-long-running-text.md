# Stopping long running messages

From time to time you may have a long running series of messages that you'd like to stop.

This can be done by performing the **!stop** command which stop the currently speaking voice. If  you'd like to cease all other speaking as well including any queued audio perform **!stop all**

To perform this command you will need to be have control of the Talkbot \(be it's master\), be permitted,  be a server admin or have server management permissions.

Example to stop current message:

```text
!stop
```

Stop all messages in queue:

```text
!stop all
```
